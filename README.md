# Chat-App

# Introduction
Welcome! This is one of my projects, made specifically for [High Seas Hack Club](https://highseas.hackclub.com/). It is the source code for a chat app, where you can, well, chat. It is entirely free and open-source, and can be deployed anywhere (not that I give you the permission to do it).

The reason it's called the way it is is because I couldn't come up with a better name.

# Functionality
The user interface consists of direct messages and group chats, which, might not seem a lot considering the functionality of modern messagers, however, I am doing everything, including the authentication, from scratch (because I found using external libraries or APIs more diffuclt). So far, it is extremely "work in progress" and I do not even have a way to serve the app because I have not worked on integrating the front- and back-end together. But for now, you can preview the UI and make suggestions ðŸ˜Š!
